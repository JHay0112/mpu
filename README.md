# Microprocessor

This project will produce a small experimental RISC-V microprocessor in VHDL. This microproccesor 
will be used to experiment with the internal architecture of a microprocessor with a focus on the 
implementation of instruction pipelining.

This design is being built for the Nexys 4 DDR development board in particular. To build for this 
board in Xilinx Vivado it is necessary to use the constraints file found at
